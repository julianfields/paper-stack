## paper stack

A compass mixin for making paper stacks.

Paper stack is just a simple implementation if a mixin using compass to make a block elements into stacks of paper. You can set paper color, border color and there is also an option to set a background image too (for those soft fuzzy noise textures you all love so well).

The demo has a simple implementation. The title letters use the mixin as well as the divs holding the code gists. Please play with the mixin and if you would like to improve it, send me a pull request.
